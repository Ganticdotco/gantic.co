MVP Personal Website

Slowly working on building myself a website in my downtime.

So far this project has helped me:
- Get more confident in HTML & CSS
- Vaguely understand server tech, domain management, email setup etc
- Start learning some vanilla JS (previously had only used JQuery)

â€¦and the big one:
- Start to comprehend GIT a little better ðŸ‘‹

I'm super keen to be given tips and pointers on any of these things, especially by anyone actually qualified enough to give such advice ðŸ¤“

I should probably stop getting distracted with all this fun stuff though and start trying to dig up some work I can post â€“ and finally add a portfolioâ€¦
